{\bf\em Motivation}

\begin{itemize}
\item
     can also use persistent skiplists to solve planar point location problem
\end{itemize}

{\bf\em In-Place Priority Search Trees}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  root of subtree is highest y-coordinate in subtree
\item
  some x coordinate is chosen as a pivot
\item
  left child subtree is left of pivot
\item
  right child subtree is right of pivot
\item
  optional:building\\
\begin{verbatim}
	                o
	            /       \ 
	          o           o
	  ------/---\-------/---\------ already built above here
	       o     o     o     o
	      / \   / \   /
	     o   o o   o o           <- note: unbalanced
	    |  k1 | k1  | k2  | k3  |
\end{verbatim}
\end{itemize}

{\bf\em Persistence}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  persistent binary search tree
\item
  the old version of a node's pointer is saved at every change
\item
  used to solve planar point location problem
\end{itemize}

{\bf\em Skiplists}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  linked list with randomized pointers to further in the list
\item
  random node ``height'', height determines number of forward pointers
  to next node of at least the ``height'' of the pointer
\end{itemize}

{\bf\em Solution}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  An array A of points sorted by y-coordinate
\item
  A persistent skiplist where the timestamp of the skiplist corresponds to the
  location of the point with lowest y-coordinate in A
\item
  So the skiplist at a given timestamp corresponds to all of the points at or
  above the point at location timestamp in A
\end{itemize}

{\bf\em LeftMostNE Algorithm}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  binary search on A to find lowest point higher than y bound
\item
  skip list traversal to find left most point higher than x bound
\end{itemize}
