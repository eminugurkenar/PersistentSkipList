{\bf\em In-Place Priority Search Trees}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  root of subtree is highest y-coordinate in subtree
\item
  some x coordinate is chosen as a pivot
\item
  left child subtree is left of pivot
\item
  right child subtree is right of pivot
\item
  optional:building
\begin{verbatim}
	                o
	            /       \ 
	          o           o
	  ------/---\-------/---\------ already built above here
	       o     o     o     o
	      / \   / \   /
	     o   o o   o o           <- note: unbalanced
	    |  k1 | k1  | k2  | k3  |
\end{verbatim}
\end{itemize}

{\bf\em Skiplists}
\begin{itemize}
\item
  A series of linked lists organized by height
\item
  Bottom most list contains all nodes
\item
  Probability of being in the next list up is 1/2
\item
  Expected height of a node is $\sum\limits_{k = 1}^\infty {\frac{1}{2^k}}=2$
\end{itemize}

{\bf\em Solution}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  can also use persistent skiplists to solve planar point location problem
\item
  partition the plane into vertical slabs positioned at the x-coordinate of
  each point
\item
  save a skiplist for each slab
\end{itemize}
