* Constant Size ListNodes
  Now: ListNodes can have an arbitrary number of next pointers,
  but this means logarithmic time to find the next pointer at a given
  time.

  Ideally: use fixed size next pointers, and create a new node when
  more next pointers are needed.  This gives constant time lookup for
  next pointer at a given time.

* Search
  Now: it's possible to search through a PSL manually

  Ideally: search should really be encapsulated so the details can be
  hidden from users.
