* Smart Pointers
  already using reference counting, should decouple the reference
  counting code from the rest of the data

* Remove templates from ListNodes
  Replace with void* and let the data structure ensure type safety.
  - How can we do this and still ensure the data are sortable??

* Search
  Right now, it's possible to search through a PSL manually, but this
  should really be encapsulated so the details can be hidden from
  users.

* Bug fixes

** references are being lost
   this will be fixed with smart pointers
