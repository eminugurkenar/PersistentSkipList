* Constant Size ListNodes
  Presently, ListNodes can have an arbitrary number of next pointers,
  but this means logarithmic time to find the next pointer at a given
  time.

  A better design uses fixed size next pointers, and creates a new
  node when more next pointers are needed.

* Remove templates from ListNodes
  Replace with void* and let the data structure ensure type safety.
  - How can we do this and still ensure the data are sortable??

* Search
  Right now, it's possible to search through a PSL manually, but this
  should really be encapsulated so the details can be hidden from
  users.
