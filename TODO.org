* Constant Size ListNodes
  Now: ListNodes can have an arbitrary number of next pointers,
       but this means logarithmic time to find the next pointer at a
       given time.

  Ideally: use fixed size next pointers, and create a new node when
           more next pointers are needed.  This gives constant time
           lookup for next pointer at a given time.
